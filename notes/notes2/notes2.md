# Lecture 2 Introduction to Linux Notes

### 1. What is an Operating System?
An Operating System is the main software that manages a computer's hardware and allows users and programs to run.

* It controls CPU, memory, storage, and devices
* Runs applications
* Provides a user interface
### 2. What is a kernel?
The kernel is the core of the operating system:

* It communicates with hardware
* Manages memory and CPU
* Controls processes
* Handles input/output
### 3. Which other parts aside from the kernel identify an OS?
Besides the kernel, an OS includes:
* **System libraries**- help programs talk to the kernel
*  **Shell/Command Line**- lets users run commands
### 4. What is linux and linux distribution?
Linux is an open-source kernel created by Linus Torvalds. It is NOT a full OS by itself.

A Linux distribution is the software, tools, package manager, and interface of Linux. Examples:
* Ubuntu
* Debian
* Fedora
* Arch
### 5. List at least 4 linux characteristics:
* **Open Source**- Anyone can view/modify the code
* **Multi-user**- Many users can use the system
* **Multitasking**- Runs many programs at once
* **Secure**- Runs many programs at once
* **Stable**- Rarely crashes
* **Portable**- Runs on many devices
### 6. What is Debian?
Debian is a popular Linux distribution known for:
* Stability
* Security
* Free software philosophy
* Large software repository
### 7. List and define the different types of licensing agreements
1. Proprietary License
* Closed source
* You can not modify it
* Owned by a company
Examples: Windows

2. Open Source License
* Source code is public
* Can modify it and share
Example: Linux

3. Free Software License (GPL)
* Gives users full freedoms
* Must keep software free when shared
Example: GNU GPL

4. Shareware/Freeware 
* Free to use (sometimes limited)
* No access to source code
Example: trial software
### 8.  What is Free Software? Define the 4 freedoms.
Free software means users control the software, not companies.
It gives 4 freedoms:

**Freedom 0**
Run the program for any purpose
**Freedom 1** 
Study and change the source code
**Freedom 2** 
Share copies with others
**Freedom 3**
Share modified versions
### 9.  What is virtualization?
Virtualization is using software to create virtual computers (VMs) inside a real computer.

It allows you to:
* Run multiple OSs at once
* Test systems safely
* Save hardware costs
